Imutils: 
Imutils is a python library that provides a series of convenience functions to make 
basic processing operations easier with openCV and Python.


Gaussian 
Replaces the central elements with the calculated weighted mean of pixel values under the kernel area.
In Gaussian blurring, pixels closer to the central element, contribute more to the weight. Gaussian blurring 
is used to remove noise following a gaussian distribution.



Threshold:
In Python, thresholding is an intensity transformation technique used to create a binary image from a 
grayscale image. The basic idea is to set a threshold value, and then classify each pixel in the image 
as either black (0) or white (255) based on whether its intensity value is below or above the threshold.


Contours:
Contours are defined as the line joining all the points along the boundary of an image that are having the same intensity.
Contours come handy in shape analysis, finding the size of the object of interest, and object detection.
